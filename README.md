# Image Processing
# Face Recognization 
Building a face recognition demo using Eigenfaces approach. collected my own images of 10 persons for this project, at least 12 images per persons, ten for building the model and two for testing.
Recognize image then using the PCA transformation obtained earlier, get the 5-dimensional representation for every test image, then apply 1-NN classification to perform recognition.

A technique to detect and recognize traffic signs.
The detection process using OpenCV technique to detect a sign in an image, achieved in grayscale with Region Of Interest
Recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the extracted features are projected into one-dimensional subspace. 
The projected sign image is recognized using K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier
