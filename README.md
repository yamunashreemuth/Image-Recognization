# Image-Recognization
Building a face recognition demo using Eigenfaces approach. collected my own images of 10 persons for this project, at least 12 images per persons, ten for building the model and two for testing.
Recognize image then using the PCA transformation obtained earlier, get the 5-dimensional representation for every test image, then apply 1-NN classification to perform recognition.
